# Foundational Arduino Projects for Robotics

This repository documents a collection of projects focused on the fundamentals of robotics and electronics using the Arduino platform. The projects progress from basic actuator control to the construction of a simple mobile robot.

## Projects

### 1. [LED Blink & Fade](./01_led_blink_and_fade/)
* **Objective:** To understand basic digital output and Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) for controlling actuators.
* **Outcome:** Successfully implemented both a standard blinking sequence and a smooth fading (breathing) effect on an LED.

### 2. [Sensor-Controlled LED (Automatic Light)](./02_light_sensor_led/)
* **Objective:** To read analog sensor input from a photoresistor and trigger an output based on environmental conditions.
* **Outcome:** Developed a system that automatically activates an LED in low-light conditions, demonstrating a basic sense-and-act loop.
* **Wiring Diagram:**

### 3. [Two-Wheeled Remotely Controlled Car](./03_remote_control_car/)
* **Objective:** To control DC motors using an L298N motor driver to achieve basic robot locomotion.
* **Outcome:** Assembled a mobile robot chassis and implemented remote control functionality for forward, backward, and turning movements via serial commands.

## Key Concepts & Skills Covered
* Proficiency with the Arduino IDE and its C/C++ based programming language.
* Understanding of digital and analog I/O for interfacing with sensors and actuators.
* Hands-on experience in basic circuit assembly and actuator control (LEDs, DC motors).
